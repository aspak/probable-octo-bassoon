# Project Title
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
This project will use data collected about how a user exercices to recommend the activities for the day that will best meet their goal. Taking into acount factrors such as sleep, fatigue, and what the user finds fun, AI methods can be used to better avoid injury and make progress while not burning out.
## Background
Sometimes exercise is seen as a chore, and often people are not good at managing their workout schedule to maximize the efficiency of their workouts while avoiding injury. Hopefully this project can succeed in a way that no other solution has at this point -- exercise should still be fun and sometimes the raw efficiency of a workout should be set aside in order for someone to enjoy themselves. I envision this project as being a companion through a lifetime of exercise, not a tool to be used to train for a marathon and then ignored after. Instead, AI could enrich the user's life by emphasizing the importance of exercise and fitting it within the existing structure of someone's life.
## How is it used?
The users are casual athletes who are interested in exercising throughout their life for enjoyment and health benefits. The needs of these users is to have good advice that grows with them and provides them with suggestions they can implement into their lives without spending a lot of time researching exercise physiology, recording data, or otherwise having to think about exercise planning. This if for the person who wants to get the most out of the time they have without becoming an exercise geek. They enjoy exercise but are discouraged by the effort and time it takes to track their progress and plan.
## Data sources and AI methods
With wearable devices collecting things like heart rate and GPS posiiton, many people who run can collect very detailed data on their workout. For bikers, power meters allow for constant measurement of work output during a workout. Many other activities benefit from the same technology, including rowing, swimming, skiing, and hiking. This makes it possible to perform classification of workouts by the intensity and duration, as well as other factors. Looking at the frequency of workouts and the types along with other information such as sleeping/recovery, their mood, their enjoyment of the activity can then be used to schedule the user for future workouts by predicting the most effective use of their time. Incorporating some measure of what the user likes to do will help to ensure the user is motivated to keep exercising and not see it as a chore.
## Challenges
This project is limited by the same things that currently make exercise planning difficult. It probably cannot work for someone who misses a lot of workouts or ignores the plan. 
## What next?
The more factors that are incorporated and the more things that collect information automatically, the better. For instance, if the user can go for a run, walk into the house and immediately have the run uploaded to the server for analysis then the whole process begins to integrate seamlessly into their life. In other words, the less a user has to think about it the better.
